DSA Tracker

DSA Tracker is a personal tool I built to organize, track, and visualize my progress in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). With this tracker, I can:

Record questions solved, categorize them by topic, and track difficulty levels.

Get insights into my strengths and areas that need improvement.

Maintain consistent practice to prepare effectively for coding interviews at top tech companies.

Key Features:

Add & Track Questions: Add DSA problems with details like topic, difficulty, and status (solved/pending).

Progress Visualization: Quickly see which topics youâ€™ve mastered and which need focus.

Responsive UI: Built with [React/your stack], with a clean and user-friendly interface.

Why This Project?
This project showcases my skills in:

Frontend Development: Implementing dynamic and interactive UI.

State Management: Efficiently handling and updating data.

Full-Stack Concepts (if backend included): CRUD operations and data persistence.

Future Enhancements:

Integration with external APIs like LeetCode/GFG to fetch questions automatically.

Analytics dashboard for advanced performance insights.<img width="937" height="419" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e54850db-66b2-4d7f-9f27-562b5f994bb3" />
